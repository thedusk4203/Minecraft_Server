# Roadmap — MVP v0.1

## Phase 0 — Product foundation
Status: in progress

Deliverables:
- Product specification
- Game design foundation
- Technical architecture
- Agent operating rules
- MVP acceptance criteria

Exit gate:
- Scope is narrow enough that an implementation agent can work without inventing product direction.

## Phase 1 — Local technical skeleton
Deliverables:
- Repository layout
- Paper-compatible plugin project
- Local development environment
- PostgreSQL development database
- Java + Bedrock crossplay proof
- Basic logging and health diagnostics
- CI build/test workflow

Exit gate:
- A clean checkout can be built and a local test server can be started reproducibly.
- Java and Bedrock test clients can join.

## Phase 2 — Core platform
Deliverables:
- Player identity abstraction
- Persistence layer and migrations
- Audit/event logging
- Permissions integration
- Economy transaction ledger
- Admin diagnostics

Exit gate:
- Restart/reconnect tests preserve player state.
- Economy mutations are auditable and duplication-safe.

## Phase 3 — First playable loop
Deliverables:
- Onboarding
- Land protection integration
- Currency loop
- Skills/jobs baseline
- Trading/market baseline
- Starter objectives/quests

Exit gate:
- New player can join, understand the objective, claim land, earn currency and complete an initial progression loop without staff intervention.

## Phase 4 — PvE content
Deliverables:
- Encounter framework
- First boss
- First dungeon/equivalent structured PvE activity
- Reward tables
- Encounter telemetry

Exit gate:
- A small party can complete the full PvE loop repeatedly without duplication/data-loss bugs.

## Phase 5 — Commerce and cosmetics
Deliverables:
- Entitlement model
- Cosmetic framework
- Supporter ranks
- Purchase delivery idempotency
- Audit trail
- Policy/compliance review

Exit gate:
- Test purchases can be delivered, retried and reconciled without duplicate grants.

## Phase 6 — Operations
Deliverables:
- Backups
- Restore drill
- Metrics/dashboard
- Alerting
- Moderation baseline
- Discord integration
- Staging deployment

Exit gate:
- Seven-day staging soak without critical manual intervention.

## Phase 7 — Closed alpha
Target:
- >= 20 invited testers

Validate:
- onboarding completion
- session length
- obvious economy exploits
- Java/Bedrock parity
- stability
- first retention signals

No feature expansion is allowed solely because testers request more content. Fix core-loop and reliability issues first.

## Phase 8 — Public MVP
First milestone:
- 20–30 stable concurrent players

Primary metrics:
- D1 / D7 retention
- onboarding completion
- average session duration
- return frequency
- economy inflation/sinks
- error/crash rate
- payer conversion and ARPPU

## Expansion gate
Do not add a second major game mode until:
- the existing mode has stable retention,
- operational burden is under control,
- player density can support splitting the population,
- and telemetry identifies a concrete opportunity.

Candidate expansion after the gate:
- Skyblock
- Prison
- additional survival shards/content

## Immediate next implementation task
Create the local technical skeleton in Phase 1.

Acceptance checklist for that task:
- Gradle or Maven build selected and documented.
- Current supported Java version pinned.
- Paper-compatible plugin loads successfully.
- Test server startup scripted.
- PostgreSQL development service reproducible.
- CI compiles and runs tests.
- No secrets committed.
